Data analysis of a MadGraph-based simulation of p p collision to 3 lepton + 2 neutralino1 + neutrino, part of the homework of the course "Analisis de datos para física de partículas" (Data analysis for particle physics), part of the Physics Engineering courses at UNAB (Universidad Andrés Bello, Chile).

The analysis was inspired by ```arXiv:2106.01676``` and is at ```scripts/EventDiscrimination.py```, some plots are shown in ```analysis.ipynb``` and ```test.ipynb```
